For my final project in CS 336, I would like to work on the Volunteer Portal for Dutton Christian. When I was looking ahead to these projects, Ethan Clark asked me if I would like to work on this project with him, because he had gone to Dutton Christian and thought it would be cool to give back to the school. My goal for this project would just be to create a simple, easy to use way for volunteers to sign up for tasks at the school. Users could log in with their e-mail, so that when they have volunteered for their task, they would be able to receive e-mails pertaining important information about the volunteer task. We would remain in contact with a few people from DCS to ensure that the web service meets their requirements. On this project, I would like to work with Ethan Clark and Kyle Reitsma, if a group of three would be possible for us.
